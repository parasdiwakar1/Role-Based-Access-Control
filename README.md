### **Objective**

To evaluate your creativity, understanding, and technical skills in building a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** User Interface. This assignment is designed to give you the flexibility to showcase your problem-solving abilities and your personal approach to designing secure and functional UIs.

> Note:
> 
> 
> If you have already implemented an RBAC UI in any project, you can submit that project for evaluation. Be sure to include a detailed description and links to the repository or deployment.
> 

### **Key Instructions**

- **You don’t have to follow any specific structure.**
    
    You are free to design the UI, features, and models as you see fit, based on your understanding of an ideal RBAC system.
    
- **Creativity is encouraged.**
    
    Feel free to innovate and add features or designs that you think would enhance the functionality or user experience.
    

### **Flexibility**

You have full freedom to:

- Choose any frontend framework or library (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
- Implement any UI design approach you prefer (table views, modals, inline editing, etc.).
- Define the data models, UI components, and workflows as per your understanding.

---

### **Scenario**

Imagine you are tasked with building an admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions. The goal is to design a secure and user-friendly interface where administrators can assign roles, define permissions, and manage users efficiently.
### **Core Requirements**

1. **User Management:**

    - Provide a way to view and manage users.
    - Include options to add, edit, or delete users.
    - Enable assigning roles to users and managing their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).
2. **Role Management:**
    - Create a way to define and edit roles.
    - Allow roles to include permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
    - Design a method to assign or modify permissions for roles.
    - Display permissions clearly for ease of understanding and modification.
4. **Custom API Simulation (Optional):**
    - Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
    - Simulate server responses to validate functionality.
1. **Creativity and Design Quality:**
    give redme fill code  
    The visual appeal, layout, and innovative elements in the design. How well the UI aligns with the RBAC theme and the creative enhancements implemented.
    
2. **Responsiveness:**
    
    How effectively the UI adapts to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.
    
3. **Functionality:**
    
    Implementation of core RBAC features, such as user and role management, permissions handling, and CRUD operations.
    
4. **User Experience (UX):**
    
    The intuitiveness, accessibility, and fluidity of interactions within the UI, ensuring ease of use for administrators.
    
5. **Technical Skill:**
    
    The quality of code, modularity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Consideration of client-side security and efficient use of resources.
    
6. **Documentation:**
    
    Clarity and detail in the README file, including setup instructions, project overview, and explanation of features.
    
7. **Security Practices:**
    
    Awareness and implementation of basic security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to ensure robustness.
    
8. **Additional Features (Bonus):**
    
    Any extra functionalities or enhancements, such as sorting, filtering, search capabilities, or innovative workfl

Here's a README file template for your project:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI
A React.js and CSS-based project implementing a user-friendly and secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This project includes a Dashboard, Timeline, Overview, Board, Login/Signup pages, and other core RBAC features to manage users, roles, and permissions effectively.

Features
1. Dashboard
An intuitive admin dashboard to access and manage key RBAC features.
Displays user statistics, roles, and permissions summary.
2. User Management
View and manage users with options to:
Add, edit, and delete users.
Assign roles to users and update their status (Active/Inactive).
3. Role Management
Define and edit roles with:
Permissions like Read, Write, and Delete.
Custom attributes for fine-grained control.
4. Dynamic Permissions
Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.
Display clear, organized permission data for easy management.
5. Timeline
A visual timeline to track user activities and changes.
Useful for auditing and monitoring RBAC-related actions.
6. Overview
A consolidated view of users, roles, and permissions.
Designed for quick insights into system configurations.
7. Board
A collaborative board to manage and organize user assignments, role workflows, and projects.
8. Login/Signup System
Secure authentication for admin and users.
Ensures restricted access to RBAC features based on roles.
